# DBMS vs. RDBMS

## ðŸ§¾ What is DBMS?

A **Database Management System (DBMS)** is software that handles the creation, maintenance, and use of databases. It provides tools and interfaces to create, retrieve, update, and manage data.

### Key Features:
- Stores data in files, not necessarily in tabular format
- No strict relationships between data
- Supports a single user or limited multi-user support
- Example systems: Microsoft Access, FileMaker

## ðŸ§¾ What is RDBMS?

A **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** is a specific type of DBMS that organizes data into tables (rows and columns) based on a **relational model**.

### Key Features:
- Data is stored in structured tables
- Relationships between tables are defined using keys (Primary and Foreign Keys)
- Ensures data integrity and supports ACID properties
- Example systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

## ðŸ”‘ Key Differences Between DBMS and RDBMS

| Feature                | DBMS                          | RDBMS                            |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Data Storage           | Files or simple tables        | Tables with relationships        |
| Data Integrity         | Limited                       | Enforced with constraints        |
| Multi-user Access      | Limited                       | Supported                        |
| Keys (Primary/Foreign) | Not required                  | Required                         |
| ACID Compliance        | Not guaranteed                | Fully compliant                  |
| Examples               | MS Access, FileMaker          | MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server        |

## ðŸ§  Summary

- **DBMS** is useful for smaller datasets or single-user applications.
- **RDBMS** is preferred for structured, multi-user environments with integrity constraints.
- Understanding this difference is critical to choosing the right database solution.
